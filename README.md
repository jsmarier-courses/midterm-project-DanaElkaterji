## Template for the Midterm Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This analysis focuses on identifying areas for improvement within the Garbage and Recycling service. The data was provided by the City of Ottawa's open data portal. Initially, I aimed to understand the impact of different channels for requests that have remained unresolved for as long as four months. After data cleaning and exploratory analysis, I discovered a notable trend from the service requests submitted via email that had the lowest resolved rate and a high cancellation rate, indicating potential inefficiencies. Improving the responsiveness of email channels could enhance the overall service quality, enhancing waste management efficiency and environmental sustainability.
